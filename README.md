# Gvahim python book - solutions
The repo contains my solutions for the legacy [Gvahim python book](http://data.cyber.org.il/python/gvahim_python_book.pdf) with adaptions for python 3.X.

I love this book, I think that this is the simplest way for Hebrew speakers to start their first steps on python2.7.

I heard that some people learned python2.7 by this book, and want to move to python3.X, that's the reason I decided to write up those solutions.

The exercises in this book are not numbered, you can find a specific exercise by chapter and page.
## Disclaimers
Those solutions are not meant to be used by Gvahim's class students, actually, if you use it, it called **cheating**. Use your teacher and mentor instead!

I don't claim to have the best solutions and algorithms in the yard, if you got subtle solutions for the exercises, make a pull request! :)
Be aware that every solution should use only the tools that have been learned till that part. for example: don't write functions before chapter 5.

I may read and understand exercises wrongly, ADHD happens :P
